### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer musician and game/audio programmer specialising in Rust and web audio, live coding and music AI. I publish open-source software and perform live coding music under the moniker 'chaosprint'. I am also an amateur freestyle football player and filmmaker in my spare time.
