### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer musician and audio programmer specialising in Rust and web audio, live coding and music AI. I publish open-source software and perform live coding music under the moniker 'chaosprint'. I am also an amateur freestyle football player and filmmaker in my spare time.

I study the interaction `within` code. It goes beyond merely using code to implement interactions; it also involves delving into the essence of code, considering code as symbols, as well as its connection to music, and designing interactions from an embodied perspective.
